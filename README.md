# opensnp-fun
This repository was created as part of the open research data hackday organized by opendata.ch.

The goal is to do PCA on the data in openSNP and then visualize some other variable along the axes of the principle components.

Code quality is not very good, as everything here has been slapped together as quickly as possible.
